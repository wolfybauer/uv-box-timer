# uv-box-timer
Simple timer for my soldermask uv exposure box (but will work for any relay situation)

Uses an old SSH1106 OLED (SPI) I had laying around, but could be easily adapted for the more modern SSD1306.
4 pushbutton interface: TIME UP, TIME DOWN, START, STOP/RESET. activates a buzzer when the timer runs out.
